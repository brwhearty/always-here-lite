Importantly, the other 300+ letters in this manuscript follow the same convention of abbreviating the recipient's name to a single initial. (It is, in fact, common in medieval letter collections.) In other words, using ""G"" in place of the recipient's name is not evidence of the medieval scribe uniquely targeting or anonymizing queer content. Many other letters in the manuscript have been connected to real historical events and people. However, both the author and the recipient of this letter have yet to be identified with historical women. Because of this uncertainty, we cannot be sure whether these are the authentic words of real medieval women or an imaginative invention. Either way, though, the queerness of the letter is blatant--and strikingly unashamed. For example, near the middle of column B, the writer declares, ""Te amare volo quousque luna cadat de polo, quia ante omnes qui sunt in mundo cordis mei fixa es profundo"" (""I want to love you until the moon falls from the sky, for before all others in the world, you are fixed in the depth of my heart"").

","This is Barbara Newman's 2016 translation of the second of three sapphic love letters preserved in the twelfth-century Tegernsee manuscript. It is not known whether this is by the same writer, or to the same recipient, as the letter that immediately precedes it in Clm 19411–although the shared initial ""G"" at the start of both makes that a tempting hypothesis. While the first letter toed the line between the personal and the public, this letter may seem to modern readers more straightforwardly intimate: with the writer, for example, describing herself as sighing after her absent beloved ""every hour, every moment, like a hungry little bird."" What may be less obvious to readers unfamiliar with medieval writing is how this language of intimacy is shot through with references to contemporary literary and biblical models, from the author comparing herself to a turtledove (in the medieval bestiary tradition, proverbially, eternally faithful to a single mate), to lifting the phrase “I look around and do not find my lover” to provide her own yearning with greater allegorical, spiritual weight. One striking difference between these two letters, which does not come through in any English translation, is how the author in this letter does not call her addressee “amica” but rather “amantem.” The first, Latin for “friend” (used in the first letter), is common in medieval literature from these centuries and this region, and is used interchangeably as a term of devotion between friends and a term of endearment between lovers. Yet while amica/friend might preserve (for both medieval readers and some modern scholars) a veneer of respectability and plausible deniability of the overtly romantic or sexual aspect of a relationship, amantem, Latin for ""lover"" or ""sweetheart"" (used in this letter) makes any attempted denial of romance difficult to take seriously.

In this letter, for instance, the letter writer appropriate’s St. Augustine of Hippo’s phrase describing the loneliness of humanity without God, and uses it to name her loneliness as she misses her beloved. This letter is also noteworthy for being more explicit, with the author reminiscing “Dum recordor que dedisti oscula, et quam iocundis verbis refrigerasti pectuscula, mori libet quod te videre non licet” (“when I remember the kisses you gave me and the merry words with which you caressed my little breasts, I want to die because I am not allowed to see you.”) The nature and cause of that lamented separation–as well as whether it is temporary or permanent–is not discussed, a gap that, while maddening for modern readers seeking a clear historical narrative, is not unusual for individual letters preserved in pedagogical collections.

In this story, a living woman encounters the ghost of her godmother, and learns her godmother has just been saved by the Virgin Mary, after undergoing cleansing punishment since her death–all because she died with a forgotten, unconfessed sin. The sin: she had “wantonly defiled herself with other girls” when she was young. Damian’s vague phrasing here means it is not clear exactly what he thinks the godmother was doing, a striking difference from Damian’s repetitive and explicit condemnations in Letter 31.
